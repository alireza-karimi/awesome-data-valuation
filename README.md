It discusses valuing a data seller's dataset from a buyer's perspective without validation requirements. The approach involves estimating statistical differences through diversity and relevance measures without needing the raw data, and designing queries that maintain the seller's blindness to the buyer's raw data. The work is significant for practical scenarios where utility metrics like test accuracy on a validation set are not feasible.</details> | <details><summary>Bibtex</summary><pre>@article{Amiri2023FundamentalsOT,<br>  title={Fundamentals of Task-Agnostic Data Valuation},<br>  author={Mohammad Mohammadi Amiri and Frederic Berdoz and Ramesh Raskar},<br>  journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence},<br>  volume={37},<br>  pages={9226-9234},<br>  year={2023},<br>  doi={10.1609/aaai.v37i8.26106}<br>}</pre></details> | | |

Federated learning is an emerging paradigm to unite different data owners for machine learning on massive data sets without worrying about data privacy. Yet data owners may still be reluctant to contribute unless their data sets are fairly valuated and paid. In this work, the authors adapt Shapley value, a widely used data valuation metric to valuating data providers in federated learning. Prior data valuation schemes for machine learning incur high computation cost because they require training of extra models on all data set combinations. For efficient data valuation, the authors approximately construct all the models necessary for data valuation using the gradients in training a single model, rather than train an exponential number of models from scratch. On this basis, they devise three methods for efficient contribution index estimation. Evaluations show that their methods accurately approximate the contribution index while notably accelerating its calculation.</details> | <details><summary>Bibtex</summary><pre>@inbook{wei2020efficient,<br>      title={Efficient and fair data valuation for horizontal federated learning}, <br>      author={Wei, Shuyue and Tong, Yongxin and Zhou, Zimu and Song, Tianshu},<br>      year={2020},<br>      booktitle={Federated Learning: Privacy and Incentive},<br>      pages={139--152},<br>      publisher={Springer}<br>}</pre></details> | | |
